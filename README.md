<h1>First project about social communication of WBUniversal using Solana ðŸ˜„</h1>

The Solana Tank Startup Project is a platform that connects potential investors with startup projects on the Solana blockchain. This platform utilizes NFT technology to create tokens representing these projects, making it easy for users to discover and evaluate potential projects.

When users submit their projects, they undergo evaluation by the Solana team and Solana's experienced "sharks" who assess them based on specific criteria. If a project meets the criteria, it is showcased to potential investors.

The project has two primary user groups: users and administrators.

Users can use the platform to:
- Discover and evaluate potential projects: Users can employ search, sorting, and categorization features to find projects that suit their needs. They can also access detailed information about projects, view evaluations from other investors, and engage with project owners.
- Add their own projects: Project developers can use the platform to add information about their projects, making them more accessible to potential investors.
- Advertise their projects: Project developers can run advertisements for their projects on the platform, increasing their visibility to potential investors.

Administrators can use the platform to:
- Manage user information: Admins can view and manage user data, including names, email addresses, Solana wallet addresses, and more.
- Manage projects: Admins can oversee project information, including status, categorization, and more.
- Run advertisements: Admins can run ads on the platform to attract new users.
- View user ratings statistics: Admins can access statistics on user ratings to gain a better understanding of user preferences.

The Solana Tank Startup Project has the potential to become an efficient platform connecting potential investors with startup projects on the Solana blockchain. This platform will contribute to the growth of the startup investment market on the Solana blockchain.

Some of the project's benefits include:
- Facilitating the easy discovery and evaluation of Solana blockchain startup projects for potential investors.
- Helping Solana blockchain startup projects reach a larger pool of potential investors.
- Creating a transparent and efficient startup investment market on the Solana blockchain.
